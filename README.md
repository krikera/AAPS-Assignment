# Advanced Algorithm Problem Solving

A collection of 40 algorithm problems and their Java solutions, designed to strengthen algorithm development and problem-solving skills.

## Overview

This repository contains Java implementations of various algorithmic problems, ranging from array manipulations, string processing, dynamic programming, to graph algorithms. Each problem is independently solved in a separate Java file.

## Problem List

The repository includes solutions to the following problems:

1. [Problem 1](ques1.java)
2. [Problem 2](ques2.java)
3. [Problem 3](ques3.java)
4. [Problem 4](ques4.java)
5. [Problem 5](ques5.java)
...and so on up to Problem 40

## How to Use

Each file is named `quesX.java` where X is the problem number. You can:

1. Review the code to understand the approach
2. Compile and run individual problems: `javac quesX.java && java Main` (assuming the class name is Main)
3. Use as a reference for algorithm study

## Topics Covered

- Array Manipulations
- String Processing 
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- Searching and Sorting
- Tree Traversal
- Greedy Algorithms
- Divide and Conquer

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:
1. Adding alternative solutions to existing problems
2. Improving the time or space complexity of current implementations
3. Adding explanations or comments to make the code more understandable
4. Adding new problems with solutions
