/*Explain the concept of linked lists and their applications in algorithm design. 

Ans:- A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored non-contiguously in memory. Each node contains:

Data (the actual value)
A pointer/reference to the next node

Basic Types:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next.

Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both next and previous.

Circular Linked List: Last node points back to the first.

Applications in Algorithm Design:
1. Dynamic Memory Allocation
Unlike arrays, linked lists don't need a fixed size.

Helpful in managing memory efficiently when size isn't known.

2. Stacks and Queues
Implemented easily using singly or doubly linked lists.

3. Polynomial Arithmetic
Store terms as nodes and process addition/multiplication term-wise.

4. Graphs (Adjacency List)
Each vertex can maintain a linked list of connected nodes.

5. Hash Tables with Chaining
Used to handle collisions by storing key-value pairs in linked lists.

6. Undo/Redo Operations
Doubly linked list helps you move forward and backward through operations.

7. Memory-Efficient Trees
Trees like threaded binary trees use linked nodes with special pointers.*/
