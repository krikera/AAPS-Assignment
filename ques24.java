/* Explain the concept of bit manipulation and its advantages in algorithm design. 

Ans:- Bit manipulation refers to the act of algorithmically operating on individual bits (0s and 1s) of integers using bitwise operators. 
It allows us to perform low-level operations directly on binary representations of numbers.

Advantages of Bit Manipulation
1. Extreme Speed (Constant Time)
Operations on bits are blazing fast and happen in constant time O(1).

2. Low Memory Usage
Bits are the smallest data units. You can pack multiple flags into one integer using bit fields.

3. Compact and Elegant Solutions
Many mathematical problems (like checking power of 2, swapping, etc.) become super elegant with bitwise tricks.

4. Solves Specialized Problems
Efficiently handles problems like:

Subset generation

Bitmasking in DP

Power of Two check

Counting set bits

Finding unique element in an array with duplicates

XOR-based problems*/
