Subsets vs. Permutations

Aspect	          Subsets	                                                                                Permutations
Definition	      A subset is any combination of elements from a set (including empty set and full set).	A permutation is an arrangement of elements where order matters.
Order	          Order does not matter.	                                                                Order does matter.
Size	          Can be of any size (0 to n).	                                                            Always uses all elements (unless stated otherwise).
Total count	      For n elements, there are 2^n subsets.	                                                For n elements, there are n! (n factorial) permutations.

Suppose you have an array:
[1, 2, 3]

Subsets:
Subsets can have any number of elements (including none):
[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]

Permutations are all possible orderings of the full set:
[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]*/
